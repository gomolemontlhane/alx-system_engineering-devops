# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to web infrastructure design.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find solutions for various tasks focusing on designing web infrastructures. Each task addresses specific requirements related to infrastructure components, scalability, security, and monitoring.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

- Design a basic web infrastructure consisting of a single server hosting a website accessible via www.foobar.com.
- Components include Nginx web server, application server, MySQL database, and a domain name.
- Address specific questions about server roles, domain name, DNS records, and infrastructure issues.
