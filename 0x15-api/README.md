# API Tasks

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to working with APIs. Each task involves interacting with different APIs and performing specific operations using Python scripts.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 0: Retrieve Data from an API**
   - Python script (`0-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py`) that retrieves data from a given API endpoint and exports it in JSON format.

2. **Task 1: Export Data to CSV**
   - Python script (`1-export_to_CSV.py`) that retrieves data from an API endpoint and exports it to a CSV file.

3. **Task 2: Export Data to JSON**
   - Python script (`2-export_to_JSON.py`) that retrieves data from multiple API endpoints and consolidates it into a JSON file.

4. **Task 3: Dictionary of List of Dictionaries**
   - Python script (`3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py`) that retrieves and organizes data from various users/tasks via an API, exporting it in a specific JSON format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for making HTTP requests)
- Access to the specified API endpoints

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies (`requests` library). You can execute each script from the command line:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
